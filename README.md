# Algorithmic Problem Solving Repository

The Algorithmic Problem Solving Repository is a comprehensive collection of solutions to a diverse set of coding challenges sourced from LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks. This project aims to provide clear, efficient, and well-documented solutions to help developers enhance their problem-solving skills and deepen their understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Key Features

### Extensive Coverage
- The repository covers a wide range of algorithmic problems, including but not limited to array manipulation, string manipulation, dynamic programming, graph theory, and more.
- Solutions are categorized by difficulty level, allowing users to progress from easy to hard problems systematically.

### Detailed Solutions
- Each problem comes with a detailed solution in one or more programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
- Solutions include comments explaining the thought process, algorithmic approach, and key decisions made during implementation.

### Performance Metrics
- The repository provides insights into the time and space complexity of each solution.
- Metrics such as time taken for execution and space consumed during runtime are documented for reference.

### Interactive Readme Files
- Each problem directory contains a well-structured README file with a problem description, examples, and any specific constraints.
- The README also includes links to the original problem on LeetCode or GeeksforGeeks for further exploration.

### Community Engagement
- The repository actively encourages community engagement through discussion forums, where developers can share insights, ask questions, and collaborate on improving solutions.
